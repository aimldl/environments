## Udacity-Deep Learning Nanodegree Program
### Part 6. Deploying a Model
  Train and deploy your own sentiment analysis model using Amazon's SageMaker. Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.

#### Project: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
  
#### Project description
    https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/parts/5b7b3a4c-10eb-4293-b821-ec6f539524dc/modules/df028333-45b5-4805-9d48-cb54a5ee1274/lessons/f680ebe0-9aa6-4183-ae4a-0cd30d07706b/project
  
#### 4. Project: Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
  
##### Project Overview
This project requests to construct an RNN
  to determine a sentiment of a movie review
  using the IMDB data set.
Additionally, deploy your model and construct a simple web app
  which will interact with the deployed model.
    
##### Project Submission    
The SageMaker Project.ipynb file with fully functional code, all code cells executed and displaying output, and all questions answered.
An HTML or PDF export of the project notebook with the name report.html or report.pdf.
