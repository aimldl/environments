# 2.2. Create a Cluster

## 2.2.1. [Using Minikube to Create a Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-intro/)

Kubernetes coordinates a highly available cluster of computers that are connected to work as a single unit.

The abstractions in Kubernetes allow you to deploy containerized applications to a cluster without tying them specifically to individual machines.

Kubernetes automates the distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster in a more efficient way.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two types of resources:

The Master coordinates the cluster
Nodes are the workers that run applications

The Master is responsible for managing the cluster. The master coordinates all activities in your cluster, such as scheduling applications, maintaining applications' desired state, scaling applications, and rolling out new updates.

A node is a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster. Each node has a Kubelet, which is an agent for managing the node and communicating with the Kubernetes master. The node should also have tools for handling container operations, such as Docker or rkt. A Kubernetes cluster that handles production traffic should have a minimum of three nodes.

When you deploy applications on Kubernetes, you tell the master to start the application containers. The master schedules the containers to run on the cluster's nodes. The nodes communicate with the master using the Kubernetes API, which the master exposes. End users can also use the Kubernetes API directly to interact with the cluster.

To get started with Kubernetes development, you can use Minikube. Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that creates a VM on your local machine and deploys a simple cluster containing only one node. Minikube is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. The Minikube CLI provides basic bootstrapping operations for working with your cluster, including start, stop, status, and delete. 

## 2.2.2. [Interactive Tutorial - Creating a Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/create-cluster/cluster-interactive/)

Check that it is properly installed

```bash
$ minikube version
minikube version: v1.8.1
commit: cbda04cf6bbe65e987ae52bb393c10099ab62014
$
```

```bash
$ minikube start
* minikube v1.8.1 on Ubuntu 18.04
* Using the none driver based on user configuration
* Running on localhost (CPUs=2, Memory=2460MB, Disk=145651MB) ...
* OS release is Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
* Preparing Kubernetes v1.17.3 on Docker 19.03.6 ...
  - kubelet.resolv-conf=/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
* Launching Kubernetes ...
* Enabling addons: default-storageclass, storage-provisioner
* Configuring local host environment ...
* Waiting for cluster to come online ...
* Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube"
$
```

You now have a running Kubernetes cluster in your online terminal. Minikube started a virtual machine for you, and a Kubernetes cluster is now running in that VM.

```
$ kubectl version --short
Client Version: v1.17.3
Server Version: v1.17.3
$
```

Letâ€™s view the cluster details.

```
$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://172.17.0.72:8443
KubeDNS is running at https://172.17.0.72:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-infodump'.
$
```

To view the nodes in the cluster, run 

```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
minikube   Ready    master   3m31s   v1.17.3
$
```

This command shows all nodes that can be used to host our applications. Now we have only one node, and we can see that its status is ready (it is ready to accept applications for deployment).
