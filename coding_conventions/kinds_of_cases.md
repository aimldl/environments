# Kinds of Cases

Several kinds of cases exist in the usage of lower and upper case letters (other than the one used in the English grammar). To list some, camel case, snake case, pascal base, kebab case, flat case, upper case, dash case, and underscore case are the popular ones. This article summarizes the knowledge on the kinds of cases useful for programming.
