 AudioFileReader Read audio samples from audio file
    AFR = dsp.AudioFileReader returns a System object, AFR, to read an
    audio file.
 
    AFR = dsp.AudioFileReader('PropertyName', PropertyValue, ...) returns
    an audio file reader System object, AFR, with each specified property
    set to the specified value.
 
    AFR = dsp.AudioFileReader(FILENAME, 'PropertyName', PropertyValue,
    ...) returns an audio file reader System object, AFR, with Filename
    property set to FILENAME and other specified properties set to the
    specified values.
 
    Step method syntax:
 
    AUDIO = step(AFR) outputs one frame of audio samples, AUDIO. After the
    file has been played through the number of times specified by
    PlayCount, AUDIO will contain silence.
 
    [AUDIO, EOF] = step(AFR) gives the end-of-file indicator in EOF. EOF
    will be true each time the output contains the last audio sample in the
    file.
 
    System objects may be called directly like a function instead of using
    the step method. For example, y = step(obj) and y = obj() are
    equivalent.
 
    AudioFileReader methods:
 
    step     - See above description for use of this method
    release  - Allow property value and input characteristics changes, and
               release audio file reader resources
    clone    - Create audio file reader object with same property values
    isLocked - Locked status (logical)
    reset    - Reset to the beginning of the audio file
    isDone   - Returns true if object has reached end-of-file PlayCount
               times
    info     - Returns information about the specified audio file
 
    AudioFileReader properties:
 
    Filename        - Name of audio file from which to read
    PlayCount       - Number of times to play the file
    SampleRate      - Sampling rate of audio file in Hz
    SamplesPerFrame - Number of samples in audio frame
    OutputDataType  - Data type of output
    ReadRange       - Range of samples to be read
 
    % EXAMPLE: Read in an audio file and play it back using the standard
    % audio device writer.
       AFR = dsp.AudioFileReader('speech_dft.mp3');
       ADW = audioDeviceWriter(AFR.SampleRate);
       while ~isDone(AFR)
         audio = AFR();
         ADW(audio);
       end
       release(AFR);  % close the input file
       release(ADW);  % close the audio output device
