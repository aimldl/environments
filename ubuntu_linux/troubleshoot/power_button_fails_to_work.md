# The Power Button Fails to Work with Dell Alienware Aurora R-Series
* [Alienware Aurora R6](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us/product-support/product/alienware-aurora-r6-desktop/docs)

## Problem
I was going to install a new OS (Ubuntu 18.04) using a bootable USB memory onto a computer with two GPU cards (GeForce 1080Ti). This computer was used by someone else and he claimed it was working fine. However it failed to boot properly. 

When I pressed the power button, the color of the button started from blue and switched to yellow. Blinked 3 times and then 6 times. I restarted the system several times and failed all the time. After a while, it somehow worked and I saw the login console. However I didn't see the alien logo which is expected at the very beginning of the boot sequence for Dell Alienware. 

I know this because I'm using the same machine for three years. Something is wrong. So I called the previous user of this computer. I asked several diagnostic questions. "Did you see an alien logo at the time of booting the computer? No". "How long have you used it? 2~3 months." He said he installed CentOS and Node.js. I assumed he left it on for a long time. "In that case, you left it on most of time, right? Yes." He might have seen the alien logo, but may not have realized it because he didn't boot the system many times.

How to access the BIOS on your Alienware System?

2. Tap the F2 key repeatedly as the system turns on
3. BIOS should load after the Alienware logo screen

@Yason The 3,6 error code is indicating that the BIOS recovery image was not not found.  I've seen a couple of posts over the past couple of weeks from people with R5's that got a BIOS Upgrade Required prompt only to have their system bricked.  Did you notice perhaps if one of the updates it did was a BIOS update?

### I talked with the guy who used to use this machine.
He got this computer a couple of months ago. No OS was installed and he installed CentOS and Node.js. He powered on this machine and left it on for a long time because he ended up not using it.

I asked him the first thing he saw when he powered on this computer. He said he didn't see an alien symbol when the computer is booted up. The first thing was a console terminal (or log-in for CentOS).

I've seen this just once after several failures to boot up the system. Only once. Afterward the computer's power button turns blue for seconds and then starts to blink in yellow 3-6 times.

I was going to follow the above insturctions and remove the battery in order to reset the BIOS. Before proceeding, I confirmed with the admin in charge of the devices in my department. He suggested not to do it by myself. So I had to stop here.

I took a video before returning the computer to record the phenomena.
