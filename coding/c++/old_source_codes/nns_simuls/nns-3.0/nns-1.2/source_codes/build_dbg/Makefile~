# Makefile
#
#    This file should be in the same directory where the source codes are stored.
#    - Compilation
#    To compile these files, run `make` in directory either bld_dbg or bld_opt.
#    These two sub-directories "bld_opt" and "bld_dbg" stand for "build the optim" and "build for debugging".
#    Both of the directories have Makefile which include Makefile.in in directory cpp_files.
#    Refer to the following directory structure.
#    
#    	\source_codes
#          Make.in
#    		\bld_dbg
#    	     Makefile
#    		\bld_opt
#    	   	 Makefile
#    
#    The reason why we maintain two separate directories is because it is possible to compile in the two directories 
#    simultaneously because the compiled results are stored in the two separate directories.

# nns.exe is used instead of nns in order to use an IDE Eclipse
