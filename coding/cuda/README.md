# NVIDIA GPU & CUDA

## NVIDIA CUDA-X, GPU-Accelerated Libraries

* NVIDIA速 CUDA-X is a collection of libraries, tools, and technologies that deliver dramatically higher performance across multiple application domains, from artificial intelligence (AI) to high performance computing (HPC).
* NVIDIA速 CUDA-X is built on top of NVIDIA CUDA速.

### Deep Learning Libraries

#### [NVIDIA cuDNN (CUDA速 Deep Neural Network)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) Library

a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks

#### [NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library )](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl)

The NVIDIA (NCCL) implements multi-GPU and multi-node collective communication primitives that are performance optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. NCCL provides routines such as all-gather, all-reduce, broadcast, reduce, reduce-scatter, that are optimized to achieve high bandwidth and low latency over PCIe and NVLink high-speed interconnect.
