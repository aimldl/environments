* This website provides a wonderful tutorial on Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

* I wish I found this tutorial when I studied Amazon EKS.

  * I personally think this website is better than the official EKS tutorial.
  * The necessary background knowledge is explained step-by-step in a concise manner.
  * It covers advanced topics such as [KUBEFLOW DISTRIBUTED TRAINING](https://www.eksworkshop.com/advanced/420_kubeflow/distributed/).
