TEXT="Slide 20 for 2 minutes. This is the first person view of AWS DeepRacer, as it drives down the track. The main components of the track are the track wall, the field, which is also considered off-track, the track boundaries are the two lines around the track surface. The track surface, or on-track (this includes the two boundary lines). And the center of the track. These components are important because we can use them to help determine whether an action resulted in a good or bad outcome. There are a few other components we should also look at. Slide 21 for 3 minutes. And that is the coordinate system and track waypoints. This is a 3D environment so it has an X, Y, and Z axis. For simplicity we are only showing the X, and Y axis. Your car has an (X,Y) position associated with it. We provide “waypoints” spread around the track in the center of the track as a series of (X,Y) points (the superimposed pink line in center of the track). The waypoints help us to programmatically determine a how much of the track DeepRacer has completed, where the center line of the track is, in (x,y) coordinates, the distance that DeepRacer is from the center of the track, and the direction of the flow of the track. We can go one step further and determine the direction, with respect to the x-axis, from one waypoint to the next. We leave this to you. We also have waypoints for the outer boundary, and inner boundary. All of these track components and track waypoints are important because after every action in the state – action – reward – new state loop, they are variables that we can use to build logic to determine whether an outcome was good or bad. Also important to call out here, and reinforce it, mind the pun, is that this feedback loop only exists in the virtual world, and as such training can only happen in the virtual world. There is no feedback loop on the physical car to help it determine if an action was good or bad."
