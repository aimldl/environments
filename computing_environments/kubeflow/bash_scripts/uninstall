# assuming it was done via a cluster.yaml file and eksctl, use this:
# That will invoke the DELETE action in the cloudformation stacks.

# TODO: figure out where is cluster.yaml for eksctl

run "eksctl delete cluster"
#run "eksctl delete cluster -f cluster.yaml"

#Note: It is possible that parts of the cloudformation delete will fail. In that case try to manually delete the eks-xxx role in IAM first, then the ALB, the eks target groups and the subnets of that particular cluster. Then retry the command, it will properly delete the nodegroups and the cluster.

#$ eksctl delete --help
#Delete resource(s)
#
#Usage: eksctl delete [flags]

#  eksctl delete iamidentitymapping      Delete a IAM identity mapping
#  eksctl delete fargateprofile          Delete Fargate profile
#
#Common flags:
#  -C, --color string   toggle colorized logs (valid options: true, false, fabulous) (default "true")
#  -h, --help           help for this command
#  -v, --verbose int    set log level, use 0 to silence, 4 for debugging and 5 for debugging with AWS debug logging (default 3)
#
