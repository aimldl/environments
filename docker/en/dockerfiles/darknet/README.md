# Dockerfile: `darknet_base_image`

## Summary

### To build a Docker image, 

Copy the `Dockerfile` (to the current working directory) and run

```bash
$ docker build -t aimldl/darknet_base_image github.com/aimldl/darknet
```

or run

```bash
$ docker build - < Dockerfile
```

## Parent tree

This Dockerfile is based off of the official Python3 image.

* Dockerfile-python3_base_image  https://github.com/aimldl/python3/Dockerfile
* Dockerfile-ubuntu_base_image    https://github.com/aimldl/ubuntu/Dockerfile
* FROM ubuntu:18.04

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Post-installation steps for Linux

* Follow the steps by https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/ and you can run docker without the `sudo` keyword.

* If you don't follow these steps, put the `sudo` keyword for each command started with `docker` in this document. That is,

```bash
$ docker images => $ sudo docker images 
```

### Command to build a Docker image from this Dockerfile.
```bash
$ docker build -t aimldl/darknet_base_image github.com/aimldl/python3
```

### Command to list the Docker images on the local machine after the built.

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
aimldl/darknet_base_image   latest              c9df18d93ec3        56 seconds ago      512MB
$
```

### Command to run the built Docker image

  Note your log-in ID is `user` and the current working directory is `/home/user`.

```bash
$ docker run -it aimldl/darknet_base_image
user@53e421cf0f92:~$ pwd
/home/user
user@53e421cf0f92:~$ ls
bin  downloads  lib  uploads
user@53e421cf0f92:~$
```

  To exit the current shell, press `Ctrl+P+Q` and you'll be returned to the previous Bash shell.

```bash
$
```

### Command to specify the container name

Use the -t option to tag a name.

```bash
$ docker run -it -t darknet_test aimldl/darknet_base_image
```

The image's name is tagged as darknet_test.

### Command to list the Docker container.
```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
53e421cf0f92        aimldl/darknet_base_image   "/bin/sh -c /bin/bash"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                            infallible_bell
$
```

  Note the container ID and name are assigned randomly as `53e421cf0f92` and infallible_bell, respectively.

### Log in as the root user

Use the -u option 

```bash
$ docker exec -u root -it [container_id] /bin/bash
$ docker exec -u root -it [container_name] /bin/bash 
```

You may use `-u 0` instead of `-u root` because 0 means the root user.

```bash
$ docker exec -u root -it 53e421cf0f92 /bin/bash
root@53e421cf0f92:~  or
$ docker exec -u root -it infallible_bell /bin/bash
root@53e421cf0f92:~
```

## Options to build this Dockerfile
There are several options to build a base image from this Dockerfile.

* The Internet connection is necessary.

The easiest way is to run: 

#### (1) Build from an URL

Build a Docker image without the repository and tag names (none).

```bash
$ docker build github.com/aimldl/python3
```

```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
<none>                       <none>              9a7c5d774254        44 seconds ago      512MB
$
```

https://github.com/aimldl/python3 is the address of this repository.

Caution: Don't use `https://` in the command or an error will occur.

```bash
$ docker build https://github.com/aimldl/python3
Downloading build context from remote url: https://github.com/aimldl/python3  52.83kB
Sending build context to Docker daemon  54.78kB
Error response from daemon: Dockerfile parse error line 7: unknown instruction: <!DOCTYPE
$
```

#### (2) Build a Docker image and name it as `aimldl/darknet_base_image`

```bash
$ docker build -t aimldl/darknet_base_image github.com/aimldl/python3
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
aimldl/darknet_base_image   latest              fe530e6951ac        44 seconds ago      512MB
$
```

#### (3) Download this Dockerfile and run

```bash
$ docker build .
```

or

```bash
$ docker build - < Dockerfile
```

#### (4) Build by specifying the file name

```bash
$ docker build -f Dockerfile .
```

Use the -t option to tag a name to the built image. For example,
  (1) $ docker build -t aimldl/darknet_base_image github.com/aimldl/python3
  (2) $ docker build -t aimldl/darknet_base_image .
  (3) $ docker build -t aimldl/darknet_base_image - < Dockerfile
  (4) $ docker build -f Dockerfile -t aimldl/darknet_base_image .
