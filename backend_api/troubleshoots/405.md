# 405 Method Not Allowed

## Problem

```bash
# API Server side error
127.0.0.1 - - [21/Sep/2020 14:27:11] "GET /timeline/1 HTTP/1.1" 405 -

# Client side error
HTTP/1.0 405 METHOD NOT ALLOWED
Allow: POST, OPTIONS
Content-Length: 178
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

Server: Werkzeug/1.0.1 Pyth/3.7.6

<title>405 Method Not Allowed</title>
<h1>Method Not Allowed</h1>
<p>The method is not allowed for the requested URL.</p>
```

## Hint

The method in the source code is checked.

```python
@app.route('/timeline/<int:user_id>', methods=['POST'])
```

`methods` is set to `POST` which is not correct.

## Solution

Changing the `methods` from `POST` to `GET` solved the problem.

```bash
@app.route('/timeline/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])
```
