Rewrite this part in README.md

## Installing Kubernetes 
### Copy the files to home
Step 1. Plug the USB memory into a USB port.
Step 2. Copy the `AUTO_INSTALL` directory in the USB memory
          to the home directory on the computer you wish to install Kubernetes.
Step 3. Open the file explorer, right-click the USB memory, and select "Eject" in the menu.
Step 4. Unplug the USB memory from the USB port.

### Run `install`
The steps in this part install the essential things both for a master and a worker node.
Step 5. Make sure to have the Internet connection. If not, set it up first.
Step 6. Open a Gnome terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t)
Step 7. cd to `bash-copy_this_to_home`
Step 8. Open `README`
  $ gedit README &
Step 9. Run `install`
  $ chmod +x install
  $ ./install


### Time laps
* It took:
  * less than 5 minutes to install Ubuntu 18.04.
  * less than 50 minutes to install Kubernetes both on a master and a worker node.

### End result
#### Master or Control-Plane Node
Run `kubectl get nodes` on the master.

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                            STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
k8smaster-alienware-aurora-r6   Ready    master   20m     v1.18.6
k8snode-alienware-aurora-r7     Ready    <none>   5m26s   v1.18.6
$
```
Note `STATUS` is NotReady soon after the installation because it takes sometime to have all components up and running.

#### Worker node
