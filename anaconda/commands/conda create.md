they are given (including file:// for local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can use 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda. You can also use any name and the .condarc channel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias is http://conda.anaconda.org/.
