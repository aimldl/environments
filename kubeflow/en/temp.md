[KFServing](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving)
KFServing provides a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition for serving machine learning (ML) models on arbitrary frameworks. It aims to solve production model serving use cases by providing performant, high abstraction interfaces for common ML frameworks like Tensorflow, XGBoost, ScikitLearn, PyTorch, and ONNX.

It encapsulates the complexity of autoscaling, networking, health checking, and server configuration to bring cutting edge serving features like GPU Autoscaling, Scale to Zero, and Canary Rollouts to your ML deployments. It enables a simple, pluggable, and complete story for Production ML Serving including prediction, pre-processing, post-processing and explainability.

[Installing Istio for Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/install/installing-istio/)

Istio is an open source independent service mesh that provides the fundamentals you need to successfully run a distributed microservice architecture. ... Istio reduces complexity of managing microservice deployments by providing a uniform way to secure, connect, and monitor microservices.

* Before you begin, you need:
  * A Kubernetes cluster created.
  * helm installed.
